# Dashboard

The dashboard is visible to all users that log in to the solution. It is also the first screen visible to a user after logging into the web interface. Currently there are two empty dashboards present. The first one, when configured, displays the average session length by fleet in minutes. The second displays the daily sessions for a given fleet.
