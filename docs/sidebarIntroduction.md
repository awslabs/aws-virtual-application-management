# Sidebar Introduction

This section of the documentation aims to provide an overview of how to operate the web-based user portal that is provided as part of this solution. The User portal presents itself with a menu bar on the left side (sidebar) of the screen with a set of icons linking to different functionality of the web interface.

Based on the role a user holds when logged into the user interface, some or all menu items will be available. The goal is to present a user only with those entries that are relevant for their work and not confuse them with additional, irrelevant, entries.

The following entries are available in the sidebar based on a user's role.
