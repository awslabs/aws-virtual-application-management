Workflows enable you to create arbitrarily composable sequences of tasks, comprised of steps. These include image recognition, text translation, PII detection and conditions.

Workflows can be triggered (executed) either manually or when an event occurs, such as file upload.

Workflows can also be reused, forming templates from which new workflows are created.
